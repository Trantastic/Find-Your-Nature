# Find-Your-Nature: Project 1 - Group 4
_This project was developed by: Frank Valdez, Julie Nguyen, Konstantin Tikhonov, Vaibhav Tank, & Yvette Tran_

## Description ##

Find Your Nature is a web app written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to assist users in finding national attractions (i.e. parks, monuments, trails, etc.) in the US. Data is pulled from the National Park Service API to provide general information regarding the national attraction. Users also have access to weather data, air quality, park alerts, as well as reviews from other users.


## Demo ##

## How-To ## 

If you want to load the app onto your computer, please clone the repo using this link: [git@github.com:v-tank/Find-Your-Nature.git](git@github.com:v-tank/Find-Your-Nature.git)

In order to access the user comments database, you will need to create your own [Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/). In the HTML and *review.js* files, replace the `initialize firebase` code with your own. To generate your own API keys, use the links in the "APIs Used" section below to sign up for a key.
