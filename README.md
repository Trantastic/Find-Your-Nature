_This project was developed by: Frank Valdez, Julie Nguyen, Konstantin Tikhonov, Vaibhav Tank & Yvette Tran_


## Description ##

Data is pulled from the National Park Service API to provide general information regarding the national attraction. Users also have access to weather data, air quality, park alerts, as well as reviews from other users.
